[//]: # (AUTOGENERATED FROM libarray - START)

`array::contains()`
-------------------

Determines if a value is in an array.

* $1    - The value to seek in the array.
* $2-$@ - Array elements.

Examples

    local index list

    list=(one two three "four four")

    if array::contains one "${list[@]}"; then
        # This one works
        echo "one is found"
    fi

    if array::contains four "${list[@]}"; then
        echo "four should not be found"
        echo "'four four' with a space would be found"
    fi

Returns true (0) if $1 is found in the list of other arguments, false (1) otherwise.


`array::indexOf()`
------------------

Check if a value is in an array.  If the value is found, the index within the array is assigned to the destination variable and this returns true. If it is not in the array, nothing is assigned and the function returns an error.

* $1    - Destination value for storing the index that is found.
* $2    - The value to seek in the array.
* $3-$@ - Array elements.

The destination variable is only set when the element is found.

Examples

    local index list

    list=(one two three "four four")

    if array::indexOf index one "${list[@]}"; then
        # This one works
        echo "one is found at index $index"
    fi

    if array::indexOf index four "${list[@]}"; then
        echo "four should not be found"
        echo "'four four' with a space would be found"
        echo "\$index will not be updated"
    fi

Returns success if $1 is found in the list of other arguments.


`array::join()`
---------------

Join / implode an array

* $1    - Variable name to receive the joined content
* $2    - Joiner
* $3-$@ - Elements to join

Returns nothing.
